  "The story of my career as a frontend developer",
  "I was an ordinary college student. Everything changed on January 7, 2024, when I made a serious decision to devote myself to programming and came to the office for the first time, where I began my studies. From that moment on, my life became disciplined and eventful: every morning I got up at 7, studied at college from 8:30 to 1:40 p.m. (sometimes until 3:20 p.m.), and immediately after classes I went to the office, where I spent another 5-6 hours completely immersed in code. It went on like this every day for almost nine months.",
  "My journey has been gradual and consistent.",
  "In the first month, I laid the foundation: I studied the Internet, HTTP, domain names, hosting, and the principles of the web. After the first day, I started practicing with HTML and CSS, and after a month of active layout, I started learning JavaScript.",
  "For 4-5 months I have been reading javascript.info, solved problems on Codewars and strengthened algorithmic thinking.",
  "Next, I mastered Git/GitHub, npm, and then tools such as Tailwind CSS.",
  "The next stage was even more interesting. I immersed myself in React, studied the React Router at the same time, and also got acquainted with the concept of SSR (Server Side Rendering) and started working with Next.js. This provided an understanding of how modern web applications are built.",
  "Later, I mastered TypeScript, began to study design systems and the right approaches to creating interfaces. In practice, I tried to deploy projects — I used GitHub Pages and other ways to publish applications.",
  "On September 7, 2024, I officially got a job as a frontend developer. But this is not the end of my journey. Every day I continue to learn and improve my skills. My goal is to become a fullstack developer. Next, I plan to delve into the backend and databases in order to create projects from start to finish.",
  "My story is an example of how discipline, perseverance, and daily practice can transform a student into a professional in a short time. And this is just the beginning.",
